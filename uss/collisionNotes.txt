struct dContactGeom {
	dVector3 pos; 		// contact position
	dVector3 normal; 	// normal vector
	dReal depth; 		// penetration depth
	dGeomID g1,g2;		// the colliding geoms
};

pos       - records the contact position, in global coordinates.
normal    - unit length vector that is generally perpindicular to the contact surface.
depth     - is the depth to which the two bodies inter-penetrate each other.
g1 and g2 - are the geometry objects that are colliding

Every Geom is a instance of a class, such as sphere, plane, or box

dCollide is expensive so dSpaceCollide is used to weed (blaze) out useless tests
