Spaces:
A space is a non-placeable geom that can contain other geoms.
Space objects exist to make collision detection go faster.
Best to insert individual geoms into a space then call dSpaceCollide, which will perform collision culling (identify which pairs of geoms are potentially intersecting).
-these pairs will be passed to a callback function, which can in turn call dCollide on them.
Spaces can contain other spaces; useful for dividing a collision environment into several hierarchies to optimize speed

Collision Detection Functions:

int dCollide(dGeomID o1, dGeomID o2, int flags, dContactGeom *contact, int skip);
-contact points to an array of dContactGeom structures. These dContactGeom structures may be embedded w/in larger structures in the array
-if the geoms intersect: returns number of contact points generated (and updates the 'contact' array); otherwise it returns 0 and 'contact' array isn't updated
-if a space is passed as o1 or o2 then this function will collide all objects contained in o1 w/ all objects contained in o2, and return resulting contact points


Space functions: (in /include/ode/collision_space.h)
dSpaceID dSimpleSpaceCreate(dSpaceID space);
-creates a "Simple Space" which doesn't do collision culling, just checks every pair of geoms and reports overlapping AABBs.


User defined classes:
functions that will handle collision detection and contact generation b/n X and 1+ other classes must be of type dColliderFn:
typedef int dColliderFn (dGeomID o1, dGeomID o2, int flags, dContactGeom *contact, int skip);

A function that tests whether a given AABB intersects w/ an instance of X (used as an early-exit test in space collision functions), must be of type dAABBTestFn
typedef int dAABBTestFn (dGeomID o1, dGeomID o2, dReal aabb2[6]);


Utility Functions:
void dClosestLineSegmentPoints(...)
int dBoxTouchesBox(...)
void dInfiniteAABB(...)
